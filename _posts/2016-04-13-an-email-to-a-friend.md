an email to a friend:

subj: "a review of 5th element coffee"

I was biking on the path towards home, which was a temporary borrow of an empty house in the part of Madison that lies almost directly on the line between campus and strip-malldom, when the motivation to finish writing the bookmarklet I'd been working on for Cliption came over me. My friend Steve had fully declared his interest in my checking out a new coffee spot near his house (the one in which I've been happily spending my nights on an air mattress), so I, realizing there'd be no wifi at home (I meant it when I said empty), decided I might as well get this experience done with. I had almost entirely decided it would be an exceptional life event for these next two weeks I'm living in Madison if this cafe was a well put together and detail oriented place, and, with an excess of desire, I got off the path on Highland instead of University Bay and rode ahead expecting it to appear any moment.

And appear it did. As I was riding by the only tall-glass-window-enough looking place, I stared inside only to see a charismatic looking barista with big hair smiling, jumping, and waving at me to come in. I had _fully_ decided to keep biking until I remembered how close I'd come to finishing the bookmarklet, and then realized I really should finish or Sanjay would officially give up on me despite me being the only person to have written code for this side project in months, and this was enough motivation to overcome how silly it would look to walk into this cafe as if I had listened to such a stupid gesture of excitement.

As I entered, the entire staff scrambled from their laptops scattered at different tables, as if to show the appearance of a busy interior, so that they might serve my incredibly urgent need for a drip coffee. I wondered if perhaps they had detected my much more incredibly urgent need to piss, and that the one who could've only been named Marco had gotten up to assist me in holding my penis as I wee-weed into the urinal. But we'll get to my experience with the bathroom in a minute.

I ordered a mug of the drip coffee and asked when they'd be closing, as it was nearly 7:30 in the evening. The man I ordered from, who I'd later decide was named Roman, first said "technically 10 o'clock, but more like 8 or 9 tonight", then told a man, who past stories of mine would dictate could only be named Quincy, that I had ordered a "drip" (fucking fascist) and walked away as if my sleek capital one venture card wasn't worthy of his fingertips, which you'll soon see is the only thing I genuinely appreciated about the place (as I type this the entire staff has joined at a single table to watch the blackhawks game). I've always wanted slightly more condescending movements out of my baristas.

Quincy, as we'll now call him, asked what size I'd like, despite the observable (and quite observed) fact that Roman had already started my brew by grinding up some Salvadoran beans. (They are now no longer sitting at the table, but instead have become quite huddled around one end because a single laptop is showing the game). I said whatever is the largest, which I later did not receive, and asked for a glass of water, which I didn't realize was a request for an eight ounce glass filled half with ice and half with sparkling water. This was the point that I felt reality had set in and I had become quite insane: questions erupted in my head such as: "does this place appeal to a different crowd?", "what the fuck am I doing here?", and "did Steve seriously think it might compare to bradbury's?", or, in other words, "did I seriously think it might compare to bradbury's?".

The sparkling water is awful with coffee. Water exists in the cafe to soothe my gums, not to dance with them while they are assaulted and left to agonize. I want a swish of relief, not an additional kick to the stomach by my assailant's son.

When Roman finished my chemex, which is apparently the "drip" coffee ((clever fascists) have these people ever been to a coffee shop in their lives?), he brought it over in the obviously medium sized mug, and when I asked for the wifi password without saying thanks, replied with, "it's guest wifi, all lower case" which, if I were any other type of human being, could only acceptably be responded to with, "yeah, I was asking for the password". So, I typed guestwifi into my phone and computer and started typing this, realizing how great of a barista Roman would be and how little this place deserves his potential.

I, desperate for my sanity, and with no tequila in sight, fled for the bathroom, which, one would expect, was at the back of the room behind a door labeled "Restrooms" followed by the small picture of a man and woman icon separated by a line, all within a box. However, what one might not expect, is that the bathroom was actually about 45 steps behind this door, and ended up being a quite corporate place with a sharp corner for a door, two urinals, two sinks, two toilets, and hand towels made of paper.

Here follows their playlist:

Take me to church (fuck off)

High pitched, almost squealing song with the words: "shake it off" and "haters gonna hate"

Some sam smith song

Blackhawk's celebrating

Pursuit of Happiness, written by Kid Cudi, but performed by someone who could only be interpreted to be a less hawk-eyed version of Taylor Swift

Take me to church (again)

Love is wherever i'm with you (aka Home) by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, but performed by the same less hawk-eyed version of Taylor Swift

So, I've decided I'll just stay as long as I can, until 10 if possible, considering the fact that they'll all have to stay if I do. I am a caustic utilitarian: I want the worst outcome for the most people who are not me (I'm actually not sure if who becomes whom for a plural direct object).

My sparkling water is now half empty, as is my coffee, and such a symmetrical moment seems to be the only available one to do a full set of rankings:

(Taken out of 10)

Coffee: 4

Bathroom experience: 1

Blackhawks fandom: Wisconsinite

Water: sparkling

Coffee: overbrewed (source: I've had a chemex brewed coffee 75% in each of the possible days in the last 5 years)

Internet: slow because a brick wall is in the way

Wooden material the tables are made of: fake

Chairs: apparently metal but plastic

Music: lol

light bulbs: 20 edisons, well hung, but then an additional 9 overhead bulbs that are exhaustingly bright and ruin the entire experience of the edisons by making them look like regular light bulbs

Overall experience: 3 (two points of which are solely attributed to Roman)

This is now the end of my review.
