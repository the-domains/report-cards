I freed my hands made numb

fingers resting on our two backpacks

on the carpet we let the good will

decide that its light in the corridor

since you found your floral dress

leading to the slopes it sounded

we pass through the detector

cool, the windows make me travel

piercing through the clouds

i speak bad french that makes it nothing

never in the air during a ballad

you're going where there's dust

it's always dirty when we come to town

there, see the cats who live there

they sprawl the walls spray-painted

museums are your cafe, waste canvas

instead face the window I let you

love to see the crowd pressing

that will do, it will do fine

I freed my hands made numb

fingers resting on our two backpacks

on the carpet we let the good will

end our trip at customs

we get turned back from the poison USA

stuck in paradise where you market

sunglasses bootleg under a sensor

it rings inside my pocket

he hands me the keys and

cool, the windows make me travel

piercing through the clouds

i love to see a Paris that stands

when I return, when I return
