the water was still in a psychiatric ward

ducks quacking, rippling it with their vibration

a few ducks, no more

the train station shining in the artificial light of human night

a storm rolls in, 6 in Madison but 9 in milwaukee

lake michigan always covered me

the station stood, missed call to my girl

i can't balance in an empty bathroom after

beers with my coworker lead to our wives, our lives

our wives: our lives

i thought a full line was empty

now i'm in the front waiting for the train

where i don't need a hotel room

going home by joan didion

a homosexual undresses me in line

my clothes are on, my gloves are on

i walk to the train, biting, nibbling

stepping at the suitcase of the woman in front of me

i walk where the man in line won't see me

and here i am

s.v.e. resting in my ears

loving all of me with all of her

i'm not alone,

i'm just checking in with me.
