I decided to write about today.

My dad once said to me,

"you can't do anything you want",

and an inspired kid said "watch me",

but I was always tired enough

to wander in wonderlust on the grass in the backyard

with my snow pants on in the rain

but when I stopped asking "am I good enough"

I stopped being good at all.

Today I sat and played games with software and coffee

and yesterday I did the same. The New York Times travel section says Little Havana,

I yearn for cuban coffee to wake up

against the charismatic opera

from my neighbor's open window.
